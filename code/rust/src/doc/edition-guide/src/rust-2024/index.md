# Rust 2024

ðŸš§ The 2024 Edition has not yet been released and hence this section is still "under construction".

| Release version | 1.82.0 (anticipated) |

The Rust 2024 Edition is currently slated for release in Rust 1.82.0.
Rust 1.82.0 will be in beta for six weeks,
after which it is released as stable on October 17th.

However, note that Rust is a project run by volunteers.
We prioritize the personal well-being of everyone working on Rust
over any deadlines and expectations we might have set.
This could mean delaying the edition a version if necessary,
or dropping a feature that turns out to be too difficult or stressful to finish in time.

That said, we are on schedule and many of the difficult problems are already tackled,
thanks to all the people contributing to Rust 2024! ðŸ’›
