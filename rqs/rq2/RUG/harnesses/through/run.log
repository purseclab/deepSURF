========================================
========================================
The target function is `through` in `through` crate's src/lib.rs file, its definition path is `through` and source code is like below:
```rust
/// Mutate a referenced element by transferring ownership through a function.
pub fn through<T>(elem: &mut T, func: impl FnOnce(T) -> T){
    unsafe {
        let elem_ref = elem;
        let elem = ptr::read(elem_ref);
        let elem = func(elem);
        ptr::write(elem_ref, elem);
    }
}
```


        Please help me following steps on the code below to build the unit test:
        
        1. fill in the  variables in the following code using the samples without modifications and keep the type declarations
        2. construct the variables p0, p1 based on hints if there isn't a sample and fill in the generic args if I didn't give you the generic args
        3. combine all the use statements and place them inside the `tests` mod, remove the duplicated use, but don't add new ones
        
        ```rust
         
        #[cfg(test)]
        mod tests {
            use super::*;

let mut p1 = ... ;

                
                through(p0, p1);

            }
        }
                            
        ```
                                For 1th argument, `T` can be used, please use following description to construct it:
```
For `T` type in `through`, we don't find explicit bounds.
The `T` in `T` doesn't have type bounds. It might have other implicit bounds

```
For 2th argument, `impl FnOnce(T) -> T` can be used, please use following description to construct it:
```
For `impl FnOnce(T) -> T` type in `through`, we have 2 candidates: `core::str::CharEscapeDefault`, `core::str::LinesAnyMap`
the `core::str::CharEscapeDefault` can be used in through. 
the `core::str::LinesAnyMap` can be used in through.

error: could not compile `through` due to 2 previous errors

========================================
========================================
The target function is `through_and` in `through` crate's src/lib.rs file, its definition path is `through_and` and source code is like below:
```rust
/// Mutate a referenced element by transferring ownership through a function, which also
/// produces an output datum which is returned from this function.
pub fn through_and<T, O>(elem: &mut T, func: impl FnOnce(T) -> (T, O)) -> O{
    unsafe {
        let elem_ref = elem;
        let elem = ptr::read(elem_ref);
        let (elem, out) = func(elem);
        ptr::write(elem_ref, elem);
        out
    }
}
```


        Please help me following steps on the code below to build the unit test:
        
        1. fill in the  variables in the following code using the samples without modifications and keep the type declarations
        2. construct the variables p0, p1 based on hints if there isn't a sample and fill in the generic args if I didn't give you the generic args
        3. combine all the use statements and place them inside the `tests` mod, remove the duplicated use, but don't add new ones
        
        ```rust
         
        #[cfg(test)]
        mod tests {
            use super::*;
            
            #[test]
            fn test_rug() {
                let mut p0 = ... ;
let mut p1 = ... ;

                
                crate::through_and(p0, p1);
            }
        }
                            
        ```
                                For 1th argument, `T` can be used, please use following description to construct it:
```
For `T` type in `through_and`, we don't find explicit bounds.
The `T` in `T` doesn't have type bounds. It might have other implicit bounds

```
For 2th argument, `impl FnOnce(T) -> (T, O)` can be used, please use following description to construct it:
```
For `impl FnOnce(T) -> (T, O)` type in `through_and`, we have 2 candidates: `std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe<F>`, `core::const_closure::ConstFnMutClosure<(&'a mut A, &'a mut B, &'a mut C), Function>`
the `std::panic::AssertUnwindSafe<F>` can be used in through_and. 
the `core::const_closure::ConstFnMutClosure<(&'a mut A, &'a mut B, &'a mut C), Function>` can be used in through_and.
